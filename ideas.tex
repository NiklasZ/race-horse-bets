\section{Model Ideas}

\subsection{Multiple Regression}
A dumb multiple regression where we consider the next value $y_t$ to be the dependent on all previous values from other
sequences $x_t$.

\subsection{Vector Autoregression}
What even is this exactly?

\subsection{Conventional Feed-forward with window of data}
Most of the relevant betting decisions come towards the end of the sequence, so it may be easier to model it with a
smaller and simpler window of say 50 cycles before closing.

\subsection{LSTM}
An LSTM can process the horse betting pools as an h-dimensional vector in each sequence element.
The problem here is that the horse ordering is still a factor in the model.

\section{Data Observations}
While the assumption was that betpools always increase in size during the betting period, this is not the case. Roughly
2\% of the time, a bet pool can experience a reduction ranging from a \$1 to much larger amounts like \$10,000,000

The data is not very contiguous. Limiting the timestamp differences to 60 seconds already cuts the data down to 60\%.

\section{Data Improvements}
When analysing races, document from which years they are kept.
