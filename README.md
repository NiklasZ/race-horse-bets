# Horse Race Betting

This is a hobby project that explores to what extent we can predict the final betting odds of a Hong Kong horse race. 
In this type of betting system the odds are only known at the end as they are directly proportional to the total amount bet on each horse. 
For example, if players bet a total of $5000 on horse A and $1000 on horse B during the betting period, then the final odds are 5:1. 

### Why is predicting this useful?
Because knowing the final odds beforehand will also tell you *exactly* how much you can win based on the bets placed, which is useful to maximise returns for risk (win rate of the horse).
Suppose for example, you know that horse A has a 80% chance of winning  and horse B has a 20% chance.
